1. What is Emmet?
==> Emmet is a web development tool that helps users write HTML and CSS code faster and more efficiently. It's a plugin for many popular text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs).
    For ex. li*4 will create 4 li elements. 

2. Difference between a Library and Framework?
==> Both the framework vs library is precoded support programs to develop complex software applications. However, libraries target a specific functionality, while a framework tries to provide everything required to develop a complete application.

3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?
==> CDN Stands for content delievery network. At its core, a CDN is a network of servers linked together with the goal of delivering content as quickly, cheaply, reliably, and securely as possible.

4. Why react is called as a "REACT"?

5. What is crossorigin in script tag?
==> The crossorigin attribute, valid on the `<audio>`, `<img>, <link>, <script>, and <video>` elements, provides support for CORS, defining how the element handles cross-origin requests, thereby enabling the configuration of the CORS requests for the element's fetched data. Depending on the element, the attribute can be a CORS settings attribute.

6. What is diference between React and ReactDOM?

7. What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
==> By default, React. js builds your project in development mode, which includes features like detailed error messages and debugging tools. However, when you're ready to deploy your application, it's important to build it in production mode to benefit from optimized performance and reduced bundle size

8. What is async and defer?
==>  In most cases async is a good choice because it still loads and executes the code as soon as possible. Use defer if you have multiple scripts that depend on each other. defer also means that the code will run slightly later than with async .
