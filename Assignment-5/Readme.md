==> React Hooks are simple JavaScript functions that we can use to isolate the reusable part from a functional component.

4. Why do we need a useState Hook?
==> The React useState Hook allows you to have state variables in functional components. You pass the initial state to this function, and it returns a variable with the current state value (not necessarily the initial state) and another function to update this value.
